## General remarks
All physical quantities are assumed to be consistently represented through their values expressed in basic SI units
(m, kg, s, A, K, mol, cd), supported by the [LessUnitful.jl](https://j-fu.github.io/LessUnitful.jl/) package
built on top of [Unitful.jl](https://github.com/PainterQubits/Unitful.jl). 

## Electrolyte data
```@docs
AbstractElectrolyteData
ElectrolyteData
```

The default values for electrolyte data are those of an symmetric 0.1M aqueous binary electrolyte at 
298.5K with solvation number Îº=10, ion molar volumes and masses similar to those of water molecules and
diffusion coefficients 2.0e-9 ``m^2/s``. All values given in SI base units:
